                <p>Our team is partnered with the San Diego Architecture Foundation (SDAF), which is dedicated to promoting and educating about the architecture and urban design of San Diego. 
                    The SDAF hopes to inspire San Diego residents to enjoy the environments of their home, school, workplace, and communities. One of the locations the SDAF is working with is 
                    the UC San Diego campus. Although the campus of UC San Diego has been around for five decades, many San Diego residents and tourists are unfamiliar with the design and 
                    architecture of the campus. The primary goal is to increase familiarity with UC San Diegoâ€™s campus and promote engagement with the local community by providing education 
                    and recommendations to visitors.

                    We approached this from an iterative, human-centered design perspective. This included research of the problem, ideation, prototyping, risk analysis, and user testing. 
                    We began by conducting interviews and research to understand our problem and the needs of our potential users. After researching and ideating as a group, we designed several 
                    prototypes using the Figma application. This allowed us to have a working prototype, which we subsequently tested with potential users. Based on our user tests, we refined 
                    our final solution.
