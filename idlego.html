                        <span class="bold">1. Technical feasibility</span><br>
                        Our developers and designers are college students who have laptops or desktop computers. From the aspects of software technology, we decided to use react native which is a programming language has been very mature, and the system function completely can be achieved. <br>

                        <span class="bold">2. Operation feasibility</span><br>
                        The application interface design fully takes into account the habits of stakeholders. The interface has to be user-friendly and attractive, and also very simple for operation. <br>

                        <span class="bold">3. Economic feasibility</span><br>
                        The cost of this system is mainly from the cost of software development, and system only requires students to have mobile phones. The object of the application is college students. Students are a group of people with relatively small income, therefore, second-hand goods have more markets for college students. This application can not only save resources, but also save money for low-income college students. So, it is feasible in economy. <br>
