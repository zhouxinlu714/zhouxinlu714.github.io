                    <p> Living in a digital world, a website is the fastest way to increase visibility of an organization. As long as the organization was founded, I worked with a team of 
                        PM and web developers and spent a quarter on building this whole website. We believe the website itself can be used to accomplish more than an information presenting 
                        platform. We aimed to make this website function as a “window”, through which information about organization, project, members would have no barrier to flow to audiences, 
                        reversly, students could also reach out more people focused in similar academic field.

                        The main page of Triple C official website integrate multiple information in one page. Here audiences can see brand story 
                        about this organization, event timeline in a quarter and photos of each event. Since this organization is a computer science club, 
                        I want to include more computer elements in the design. In event timeline page, after clicking on each button on timeline, the detailed 
                        description will be show on the right screen in a terminal style.

                    <p>
                        On the member page, all members in organization were listed because I believe in any company or organization where the people behind are as important as the company or 
                        organization itself. It can adds a personal touch to the organization and can lend trust to visitors. Tabs above profiles were used to divide people into each department 
                        and it is easier for visitor to look for specific person. In addition, after hovering on each portrait, information icons with links including email, github, and LinkedIn 
                        will pop-up.

                        The project page is mainly to provide short introduction about each individual project. Visitors can see a short description, web/mobile interfaces demo, project timeline, 
                        and people have been worked on this project.

                        Triple C official website was my first website project, I faced many challenge when designing all website interfaces and coding. The first was to learn HTML5, CSS, 
                        JavaScript and build fully responsive web. The second was to collect some awesome CSS features and learn how to integrate them into this website like text animation. 
                        <br>
                        In the end, I want to thank for the whole team and my project manager who taught me patiently at that time.
