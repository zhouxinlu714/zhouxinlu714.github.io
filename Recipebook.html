                Before the project started, we conducted several brief, unstructured interviews with individuals who we

                first round of user research, we conducted 8 user interviews and then came together as a team to discuss
                the insights.

                To better understand how students cook in their daily life and identify potential problems, I advocated
                for conducting Semi-structured Interviews first before diving into solutions. I also encouraged our
                developers to join us for affinity mapping sessions so that we could brainstorm solutions as a group
                based on our results.

                        <p>After coming up with 37 ideas in total, we decided to use the Impact & Effort matrix template
                            to prioritize them in order of importance and assess their feasibility. Then we narrow
                            down top 3 ideas from our 12 different concept sketches:

                <p class="text-dark section-subtitle">Paper Sketch & Wireframe</p>
                <p> After I finished the information architecture, I started looking into the paper wireframe that
                    allows me to visualize how each component and visual element should be positioned on the page.  It
                    also gave me a chance to think about information hierarchy that I can present the content and
                    function in a more structured way.  I had a bunch of discussions with the team and I iterated the
                    wireframes to make it more concise and align with everybody's expectation.

                <p>
                    Now that we had an idea from our minimum viable prototype, we sketched out some ideas and thought
                    about what our app and user interface might look like.
                </p>

                We decided to call out 3 main features:
                <ol>
                    <li>Meal plan + shopping list : where students could easily plan their weekly meals, get a shopping
                        list with them in market, and let the app picks recipes from your saved lists.</li>
                    <li> Scan ingredient to get recipes recommendation : where students can learn new ingredient and get
                        recommended recipes to cook it.</li>
                    <li>Upload personal recipe: where students can upload their personal recipes by inputting steps and
                        link, or share link to family and friends to get their secret recipes.</li>

            <div class="section-content">
                <p class="text-dark section-subtitle">User Testing</p>
                <p>To evaluate the usability of our app, our team conducted 5 user tests with some of our wireframes and
                    initial designs with participants. We summarized our main findings below.</p>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-sm">
                        Problem 1: 5/5 users had a hard time finding the "upload recipe" button. While we were
                        conducting user testing, almost all of our participants mentioned they would like to see this
                        button in an evident place that can attract their attention.

                    </div>
                    <div class="col-sm">
                        Problem 2: No clear feedbacks on actions. 5/5 users mentioned that they were not sure if the
                        recipe was added to the meal plan/favorite list successfully. Occasionally we observed that
                        users would switch to certain pages to confirm recipes were successfully added.

                    </div>
                    <div class="col-sm">
                        Problem 3: Users prefer to browse the recipes first and add it to meal plan. We found that our
                        users meal planned one week ahead max.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p class="text-dark section-subtitle">Iteration</p>
                <p>In order to address the issues uncovered above, we revised our final sketches as such</p>
                <div>
                    <h4 class="mt-5">Iteration 1</h4>
                    <p>I changed "Find a recipe" to "Add recipes" because generally people are more familiar with the
                        word “add” and it’s more consistent with user flow that they actually choose recipes from their
                        saved list.
                        <br>
                        Even though the scrollable calendar on the top enabled users to pick between day of the week and
                        date, we thought that 7 tabs on the top navigation would be crowded on smaller devices. We've
                        also noticed that most users only remember the day of the week rather than the precise date. As
                        a result, we replaced it with a weekday tab on the left with a larger clickable area and a short
                        statement to inform users of the month's week.
                        <br>
                        we also change the meal plan to second tab since user said they want to explore different recipe
                        when they landing on app rather than seeing empty meal plan.

                <div>
                    <h4 class="mt-3">Iteration 2</h4>
                    <p>In order to address the lack of feedback，we propose to give confirmation messages in the form of
                        pop-up windows to inform users that activities have been completed successfully,. The message
                        "You've successfully uploaded a recipe" will appear in the popup window.</p>

                <div>
                    <h4 class="mt-5">Iteration 3</h4>
                    <p>Users takes more than 1 mins in average, in finding how to create their own recipe and invite
                        their friends to edit together and they mentioned that the pop-up buttons are so confused that
                        they barely understand the meaning. Therefore, we integrate the upload image and friend
                        invitation to one page, users would be able to create their recipe in simple steps.</p>

                            create interactive prototype with vue.js at final stage. Even though the team was splitter
                            into designers and developers, it is important to help the entire team better understanding

                            confidence, and a sense of security, which allows them to trust the product and gain more
