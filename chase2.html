                In order to find more potential issues with the current budget control feature experience, we
                decided to compare Chase’s budget control feature with the ones in Bank of America and Discover as well
                as two other budgeting apps, Mint and Acorns. We intended to pull the strengths from these finance
                management apps and learn from the negatives of current solutions in
                other banking apps by highlighting the budget control feature in our redesign.

                Our team is working on redesigning the original function of setting alerts/notifications and adding a
                new budget snapshot feature that includes current spending analysis and a page that compares historical
                and present expenditure. Rather than having the Chase system give customers alerts only for security
                concerns, we encourage consumers to set up their own budget notifications for overall spending limits
                and category limitations in order to better manage their spending manner.

                <h3 class="text-dark section-subtitle">Low-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
                <p>
                    Before delving into paper prototypes, our team first decided to go with one particular user flow
                    above where the user can access their spending
                    analysis called “Budget Snapshot” from the home page instead of from each individual credit/debit
                    card page. The reason behind is that we found most
                    people expressed their preference to see their spending analysis right when they enter the app
                    during our user research and interview phase.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After arriving at this decision, our team started to build low-fidelity paper prototypes following
                    the same user flow but with two different
                    UIs. This allowed us to bring the two prototypes to users for A/B testing then further iterate based
                    on users’ responses.

                                the options as buttons below the line graph.

                                By clicking on each slice of Prototype A’s pie chart, users will be prompted with the
                                spending on

                            Prototype A’s pie chart is clickable, and 2) if users would prefer one
                            over the other. -->

                                B combines the two more naturally in a sliding bar. On top of that, Prototype A lays out

                We obtained further insight into our user group's mental model by testing some of our paper prototypes

                they require clear directions.

                        All of our interviewees mentioned
                        they would like to have this budget analysis feature to be obvious enough
                        so it encourages them to constantly tab on the button and utilize this feature.

                        of total spending by category seems to be redundant.

                <h3><em>Testing Method</em></h3>
                <p>Before deciding the final version of this redesign, we conducted more user testings on 4 people to 1)
                    make sure we were on the right track and 2) receive feedbacks on how
                    to further improve user experience. Since our previous user testings with low-fidelity prototypes,
                    we noticed a significant improvement with recognizing our “Budget Snapshot”
                    CTA button, largely due to the added graphics in the background that signified that button should
                    lead to some sort of data analysis. Upon entering the “Budget Snapshot”,
                    all of the users breezed through the user flow. However, almost all of them had troubles
                    interpreting our pie chart, particularly with the white dotted lines. When comparing
                    the alternative screens against our main design, most of the users preferred the alternative data
                    visualization but missed the switch tab on the alternative UI for “Manage Budgets”
                    page.

                    In left design, we added a graphic consisted of curves and bars to signify that clicking on this
                    would lead to some sort of data analysis on the user’s budget. Although the
                    graphics did draw users’ attention during our user testings, the TA Rajiv pointed out that the
                    design didn’t match with Chase’s brand and overall style. So in our new design,
                    we took inspirations from Chase’s current “Today’s Snapshot” graphs and created a yellow gradient
                    line chart that is minimalistic yet eye-catching at the same time.

                    In previous “Budget Snapshot” design, we received a lot of constructive criticism and feedback on
                    our data visualizations from both our users and the TA. So in our new design,
                    we made some following changes:<br>
                    1. We first made a subtle edit in the top graph by changing the budget limit lines to red following
                    conventions in design (red implies warning) and
                    changing the exceeded amount to bright orange.<br>
                    2. In the bottom half of this page, we changed our creative but confusing pie chart to a more
                    traditional but easy-to-understand
                    donut-shaped one, where the utter slices indicate different categories and their proportion, the
                    center always displays the total spending, and the information in the pop-up
                    window right beneath the graph changes depending on which slice the user clicks on. Below the pie
                    chart, we decided to use a horizontal bar chart to indicate the budget limit
                    placed on each category and how well the user is doing at spending within the budget.

                <p>This was my first case study project that I had undertaken. We spent 3 months working on this project
                    starting from user research to deploying the
                    final prototype and finally making an account of every step in this case study. It was a good
                    challenge to learn how to prioritize design process
                    and features, how to prototype using Figma, and have an experience of design thinking. The
                    inspiration for this feature redesign came naturally as
                    three of us had been frustrated when we saw several high-cost purchases and unnecessary expenses on
                    card bills. From our own experiences and casual
                    observations, our team believes that there is a significantly large unmet need among young adults to
                    wisely manage their budget. We also believe the
                    budget snapshot feature can help young adults cultivate better spending habits that will benefit
                    them in the long-term.
                    <br><br> In addition, this experience was also a great help for me to know design is not an
                    individual sport. Transparent communication in our team is
                    essential for the success of this project. Though we played different roles in this project and
                    sometimes had divergent opinions on the same issue,
                    we spared no effort to give each other honest feedback and real criticism. it seems that we worked
                    on distinct tasks, but we still learned from each
                    other and participated in the whole design process. Another takeaway from this project is that
                    usability testing is a critical way to help us uncover
                    insights of users and make dramatic changes to our final design. <br><br>For the next steps on this
                    project, I would like to continue to explore how young
                    adults save money for their future purchase, and how we as designers come up with more attractive
                    and creative ways to help them save budget, besides merely
                    presenting data of budget.
