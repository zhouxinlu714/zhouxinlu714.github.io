                <p>Chase budget control feature redesign is a class project for a class titled Design Human-Data Interactions. 
                    The goal of the class was to combine concepts from human-computer interaction (HCI) and data science to think, 
                    cooperate, and solve challenges in a real-life application. I work with a team of three to apply the design thinking 
                    process for coming up with solution, following the steps: research– analysis– ideate– design and test.
                <br>
                <br>
                Our team redesign feature called Budget Snapshot, aimed at helping young adults between the age of 18-24 to save for their 
                upcoming high-cost purchases. I was primarily responsible for conducting user research, designing the user interface, feature 
                ideating and user testing.

                <strong>Project Objectives:</strong> In redesigning the budget control feature, our team hopes to 1) make saving money easier by revamping the feature to be more user-friendly and straightforward, and 2) cultivate better spending habits among young adults
                <br>
                <strong>User:</strong> Our team has decided to use young adults (between 18-24 years old) as our target user. We believe young adults are an ideal target user for the following reasons.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Quantity of Users
                            In the United States alone, approximately 70% of the population owns at least one credit card. Credit card ownership is also the most prevalent among young adults: around 67% of the 18-24 years old age group owns credit cards. </li>
                        <li>Access to Users
                            As our team is comprised of college students, we have easy and plentiful access to members of our target user. Our team has access to over 30,000 UCSD students, and with the help of social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook, we are able to reach more people within the age range of 18-24 years old. </li>
                        <li>Magnitude of User Need
                            From our own experiences and casual observations, our team believes that there is a significantly large unmet need among young adults to budget spending on a daily basis. 
                            If successful, our team believes that we are well-positioned to deliver extremely impactful solutions for millions of Chase credit card owners to help regulate their spending. We also believe we can help young adults cultivate better spending habits what will benefit them in the long-term.    </li>
                    </ol>
                <strong>User Goals:</strong> Users (young adults with Chase credit cards) should be able to:
                    <ol>
                        <li>easily locate the budget control feature in application </li>
                        <li>customize limits on both spending in each category and total expenditure in simple steps</li>
                        <li>view notifications and summaries on spending intuitively</li>
                        <li>improve spending habits over time</li>
                    </ol>
                <p>
                <strong>Why this Idea:</strong> Young adults between the age of 18-24 tend to make many high-cost purchases, such as concert and festival tickets, a new laptop for school and work, and even a car to commute between difference places. And as young adults and credit card users ourselves, we recognize that the ease of swiping away and not worrying about paying back at the moment makes it extremely difficult to budget our spending and save up for expensive items we actually need.
                <br>
                <br>
                In addition, budget control features in all of the most popular bank applications ( Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo) are not only hidden but also often mixed together with security alerts. We suspect that this placement is intentional because banks do not want to limit users’ spending. However, impulsive spending leads to poor credit scores which is both harmful for the user and the bank. While some people may resort to bookkeeping by hand or separate applications to keep track of spending, we believe there should be an easier method built inside the bank mobile application to provide this service.

                <h3><em>Research Goals</em></h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Find out how users control their spending to save up for high-cost purchases</li>
                    <li>Investigate the cause of the budget control feature in Chase application not being noticed/used</li>
                    <li>Determine the most needed and effective ways to help users control their spending</li>
                </ol>

                <h3><em>Research Methods</em></h3>
                    <ol>
                    <li>Survey: Our team sent out a online Google Form survey and received responses from 81 people. The purpose of the survey 
                    was to collect answers and document preferences from a diverse group of people in order to locate pain points 
                    and come up with more specific interview questions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    2. Direct Observatons: Our team directly observed 9 Chase mobile application users while they performed a list of simple tasks, such as 
                    setting up spending limits. We chose not to intervene in the interactions between the users and the application, 
                    unless the users were unable to perform the actions after multiple attempts. This gave us an opportunity to see 
                    the users’ expectations for the feature and the gap between expectations and reality. After directly observing 
                    these 9 users, we followed up with them afterwards to ask them more questions about their interaction. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    3. Interviews: Our team conducted 9 one-on-one interviews after direct observations on the same users. We wanted to understand 
                    the reasonings behind their actions and find out what they enjoy about the current feature and what they wish to 
                    add on and change about the current feature. 
                    </li>
                    </ol>

            <div class="col-8 offset-2">
                <p> 
                    We all have a time that tend to make high-cost purchases. Young adults who just get chance to manage their money expenses 
                    are easier to make impulsive purchases such as concert and festival tickets or newly released tech products and bags. And as 
                    young adults and credit card users ourselves, we recognize that the ease of swiping away and not worrying about paying back at 
                    the moment makes it extremely difficult to budget our spending and save up for expensive items we actually need. In addition, 
                    impulsive spending leads to poor credit scores which is both harmful for the user and the bank. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    After speaking to many college students(potential users) and reflecting on our own experience, we found that Young adults aren’t really 
                    attracted to investing the time and dedication it takes to groom their finances and improve their spending habits in order to reach their 
                    savings goals but they all express strong demanding of a modern solution like an app that can help them save money. Although budget control
                    features do exist in all of the most popular bank applications (Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo), they can be easily to ignore and 
                    often are not attractive enough for people to use. we believe there should be an easier method built inside the bank mobile application to 
                    provide this service.
                </p>
                <h3><em>Competitive Analysis</em></h3>
                <p>
                    In order to find more potential issues with the current budget control feature experience, we decided to compare Chase’s budget control 
                    feature with the ones in Bank of America and Discover as well as two other budgeting apps, Mint and Acorns. We intended to pull the 
                    strengths from these finance management apps and learn from the negatives of current solutions in other banking apps by highlighting 
                    the budget control feature in our redesign.

                <p>
                    Our team form a couple of personas to help us understand users' needs, experiences, and goals. It also guides us to ideate the content of features.

                <h3><em>UX Flows</em></h3>
                <p>
                    Our team is planning on redesigning the original feature of setting alert/notification and extending a new feature displaying budget snapshot 
                    that includes current spending analysis and past & current spending comparison page. Instead of having Chase system sending users alerts simply 
                    for security reasons, in our redesign, we encourage people to set up their own budget notifications for total spending limit and category limits 
                    to manage their spending habits in a more comprehensive manner. Not only a user can access this redesign feature from the left icon hamburger menu, 
                    they can also locate this particular setting in our new feature - budget snapshot interface. Just like what BOA and Mint provided to their users, we 
                    will have a clickable pie chart that displays the amount spent on each category (e.g. 27% spent on food and grocery). Once the user clicks on a specific
                    slice of the pie chart, an option to "view transactions" will show up that can take the user to all recent transactions under this category as well. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We designed to have our extending feature displayed on the homepage so that our targeting user like Emily, representing the beginners group, will not 
                    overlook this key feature of the app and it will constantly remind her of the existence of budget control feature that can help her become more financially 
                    responsible. We also aim to have all our budget saving related features to stay as compact as possible. Unlike Acorns app which has too many scattered 
                    features across the app, we provide our target user like Brandon with a more straight-forward access to all the potential assessments this app provides. 
                    Finally, our budget snapshot feature that contains interactive statistical graphs will grant users like Taylor with a more personalized, visually appealing 
                    experiences while comparing and contrasting her spending trends on a regular basis.

                <h3><em>Low-Fidelity Prototype</em></h3>
                <p>
                    Before delving into paper prototypes, our team first decided to go with one particular user flow above where the user can access their spending 
                    analysis called “Budget Snapshot” from the home page instead of from each individual credit/debit card page. The reason behind is that we found most 
                    people expressed their preference to see their spending analysis right when they enter the app during our user research and interview phase. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After arriving at this decision, our team started to build low-fidelity paper prototypes following the same user flow but with two different 
                    UIs. This allowed us to bring the two prototypes to users for A/B testing then further iterate based on users’ responses.

                    <span class="bold">Similarities between the two prototypes:</span>To resolve the previously discovered issue of scattered budget control features, 
                        both Prototype A and B present a CTA button called “Budget Snapshot” on the top of Chase home screen. “Budget Snapshot” page reports the spending 
                        analysis with various charts based on the time period as well the the specific account depending on the the user’s choice, allowing the user to 
                        visualize their spending history and habit. This page also consists of buttons that lead to the “Manage Budget” page as well as the “Recent Transaction”

                    <span class="bold">Differences between the two prototypes:</span>Since the two paper prototypes follow the same user flow, the main differences are all within 
                    the UIs: Prototype A follows the current Chase design more closely to avoid unfamiliarity whereas Prototype B explores more creative solutions. 
                    <br>
                    1. On the home page, Prototype A strictly follows the current Chase home page design, simply replacing the “Daily Snapshot” in the original design, 
                    whereas Prototype B includes a subtle line chart in the background to better signify what “Budget Snapshot” entails. With this change, we wanted 
                    to explore which representation is more intuitive and inviting for users to enter the page.
                    <img src="Images/chase-hp.png" width="100%" alt="Daisy">
                    2. Upon entering the “Budget Snapshot” page, Prototype A asks the user to select the time period and account in a drop-down filter menu, while Prototype B displays 
                    the options as buttons below the line graph. Below the line graph, Prototype A provides an interactive pie chart while Prototype B uses a static circular chart. 
                    By clicking on each slice of Prototype A’s pie chart, users will be prompted with the spending on that category with the option to view recent transaction on that 
                    category as well. On the other hand, although the circular chart in Prototype B doesn’t have interactive elements, it allows the user to view all information in one 
                    setting. With this difference in design, we wanted to find out 1) if users would even realize Prototype A’s pie chart is clickable, and 2) if users would prefer one 
                    over the other.

                    3. Last but not least, for “Manage Budget” page, Prototype A partitions “Total Spending Limit” and “Category Spending Limit” by putting them in two tabs, while Prototype 
                    B combines the two more naturally in a sliding bar. On top of that, Prototype A lays out all the information required to set up budget limit in one page whereas Prototype 
                    B wraps “Calculate Budget Limit” in a popup window that will only show up if the user clicks on the button. With this difference, we hoped to test 1) whether users prefer 
                    seeing everything on one page or seeing a less information-heavy UI, and 2) if hiding the “Calculate Budget Limit ” behind a button would discourage users from using this feature.

                <h3><em>Testing Method</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        After finishing paper prototype, we adopted A/B testing as the testing method since it is the most fitted when it comes to comparing two prototypes with the same user 
                        flow but different UI designs. Before starting testing we wrote a comprehensive user testing and we were particularly interested in the user flow of finding budget control 
                        feature and also how users understand graphs on function page. We asked them to perform the following tasks on both Prototype A and B: 
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 2.5em;">
                        1. Find the spending analysis in the app 
                        <br>
                        2. View today’s spending analysis on Card A
                        <br>
                        3. View recent transactions on the category they spend the most amount of money on
                        <br>
                        4. Set that total budget to $800/payment cycle
                    </p>
                    <h3><em>indings and Insights</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        <span class="bold">1. Problem 1: “Budget Snapshot” didn’t get noticed</span>
                        While we were conducting interviews in the first round, almost all of our interviewees mentioned they would like to have this budget analysis feature to be obvious enough 
                        so it encourages them to constantly tab on the button and utilize this feature. In this way, we built both of our paper prototype by arranging this budget feature on the 
                        very top of each homepage. However, as our user-finding have mentioned, evaluators showed similar pattern by clicking into the specific card/account to look for budget 
                        analysis before even noticing the budget snapshot button. 

                        Solution/Plan for next steps:
                        Thus, we will be adding another access point to budget analysis feature inside of each card/account tab. Then, when users are directed to budget analysis feature, the 
                        displaying graphs will corresponds to this account information specifically.<br><br>

                        <span class="bold">2. Problem 2: Repetitive graphs and charts</span>
                        We found 2/4 of our evaluators reflected that having both an interactive pie chart and a bar chart of total spending by category seems to be redundant. In fact, our original
                         design is to have bar chart showing the budget limitation that user has set for each category which the interactive pie chart cannot fully reflect. Also, if a user has not 
                         set up the budget limitation for each category yet, the bar chart section will not show up. It seems like our design idea is not fully conveyed in our our paper prototype. 

                        Solution/Plan for next steps:
                        For the next step, we will be combining bar chart into the interactive pie chart and figure out a better way to illustrate not only the percentage the user has spent on each 
                        category, but also the the budget limit one has set up for each category in one graph. Thus, we can make the budget snapshot page much more concise with minimal functions so 
                        that users will not get too overwhelmed.<br><br>

                        <span class="bold">3. Problem 3: Complicated input fields</span> 
                        Users complained that the “Calculate Budget Limit” feature is be too difficult to use. Although asking for the user’s saving goal and days left until they need to reach that 
                        goal is reasonable, asking for the user’s monthly income isn’t helpful because it’s too complicated to estimate. And by the time users arrive at this input field, they would 
                        be too impatient to complete the calculation. 

                        Solution/Plan for next steps:
                        Instead of providing a feature to calculate the budget limit for the user, we will let the user decide their own limit. What we will do is to give smart warnings when users 
                        are approaching their budget limit and automatically adjust the budget limit for upcoming weeks/months if users exceed it.

                <h3><em>Testing Method</em></h3>
                    <p>Before deciding the final version of this redesign, we conducted more user testings on 4 people to 1) make sure we were on the right track and 2) receive feedbacks on how 
                        to further improve user experience. Since our previous user testings with low-fidelity prototypes, we noticed a significant improvement with recognizing our “Budget Snapshot” 
                        CTA button, largely due to the added graphics in the background that signified that button should lead to some sort of data analysis. Upon entering the “Budget Snapshot”, 
                        all of the users breezed through the user flow. However, almost all of them had troubles interpreting our pie chart, particularly with the white dotted lines. When comparing 
                        the alternative screens against our main design, most of the users preferred the alternative data visualization but missed the switch tab on the alternative UI for “Manage Budgets”
                        page.
                    <img src="Images/chase-hp-iteration.png" width="100%" alt="Daisy">
                    In left design, we added a graphic consisted of curves and bars to signify that clicking on this would lead to some sort of data analysis on the user’s budget. Although the 
                    graphics did draw users’ attention during our user testings, the TA Rajiv pointed out that the design didn’t match with Chase’s brand and overall style. So in our new design, 
                    we took inspirations from Chase’s current “Today’s Snapshot” graphs and created a yellow gradient line chart that is minimalistic yet eye-catching at the same time.
                    <img src="Images/chase-bs-iteration.png" width="100%" alt="Daisy">
                    In previous “Budget Snapshot” design, we received a lot of constructive criticism and feedback on our data visualizations from both our users and the TA. So in our new design, 
                    we made some following changes:<br>
                    1. We first made a subtle edit in the top graph by changing the budget limit lines to red following conventions in design (red implies warning) and 
                    changing the exceeded amount to bright orange.<br>
                    2. In the bottom half of this page, we changed our creative but confusing pie chart to a more traditional but easy-to-understand 
                    donut-shaped one, where the utter slices indicate different categories and their proportion, the center always displays the total spending, and the information in the pop-up 
                    window right beneath the graph changes depending on which slice the user clicks on. Below the pie chart, we decided to use a horizontal bar chart to indicate the budget limit 
                    placed on each category and how well the user is doing at spending within the budget.

                        <p>This was my first case study project that I had undertaken. We spent 3 months working on this project starting from user research to deploying the 
                            final prototype and finally making an account of every step in this case study. It was a good challenge to learn how to prioritize design process 
                            and features, how to prototype using Figma, and have an experience of design thinking. The inspiration for this feature redesign came naturally as 
                            three of us had been frustrated when we saw several high-cost purchases and unnecessary expenses on card bills. From our own experiences and casual 
                            observations, our team believes that there is a significantly large unmet need among young adults to wisely manage their budget. We also believe the 
                            budget snapshot feature can help young adults cultivate better spending habits that will benefit them in the long-term. 
                            <br><br> In addition, this experience was also a great help for me to know design is not an individual sport. Transparent communication in our team is 
                            essential for the success of this project. Though we played different roles in this project and sometimes had divergent opinions on the same issue, 
                            we spared no effort to give each other honest feedback and real criticism. it seems that we worked on distinct tasks, but we still learned from each 
                            other and participated in the whole design process. Another takeaway from this project is that usability testing is a critical way to help us uncover 
                            insights of users and make dramatic changes to our final design. <br><br>For the next steps on this project, I would like to continue to explore how young 
                            adults save money for their future purchase, and how we as designers come up with more attractive and creative ways to help them save budget, besides merely 
                            presenting data of budget.  </p>
